/**
 * Note: passing policy name instead of policy itself because do not want to just "return policy", 
 * since that will have all the same information that you already get in the reports, and anything
 * that serializes this class would then show redundant info.  Every rule result already includes
 * the rule itself, and since there is a result for every rule in the policy,  the entire policy
 * is represented by the set of rule results.
 * 
 * The host report is also included, which is somewhat redundant but not completely, because it
 * has information that may not be present in the rules, which the UI may want to show. For example,
 * for vmware PCR 19 which has a different value for every host due to a host-specific UUID
 * being extended into it,  the UI may want to show the actual value of PCR 19. however, if the
 * rules only check for PCR integrity and for some modules to be included, then it doesn't really
 * say what is the PCR value (and if it did, it would show the expected PCR, not the actual PCR).
 * Also if module names mismatch even though their digests are the same, that wouldn't normally
 * be reflected in the results.
