/**
 * A TrustPolicy defines which PCRs must have what values. It is different
 * than simply defining a PcrManifest because, in addition to allowing for
 * a variety of expected values, it produces a report that details the compliance
 * or non-compliance of a given PcrManifest with the policy.
 * 
 * The contract of any implementation of TrustPolicy is that it be reusable.
 * That is, it should be possible to call apply() repeatedly on different
 * HostReport instances and get a correct report for each one. The TrustPolicy
 * instance itself should NOT maintain any state regarding the last instance 
 * checked - the entire result set of apply() must be returned via the TrustReport.
