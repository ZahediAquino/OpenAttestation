/**
 * Note:  The trust-policy module and this HostReport object can only be used
 * AFTER a host is already registered in Mt Wilson and associated with a whitelist.
 * It should not be used during the registration process.
 * 
 * The AIK must be loaded by attestation service from the database and placed
 * into this instance.
 * 
 * The HostReport is the "actual value" used when determining a host's compliance
 * with a given TrustPolicy. 
 * The HostReport represents the response we get when we request a TPM quote and
 * other information from a host.  It's not the same as a TpmQuote because some
 * hosts (vmware) do not provide us real TPM quotes or AIKs.  So it may contain
 * (for vmware hosts) a PCR manifest without a TPM quote or AIK.
